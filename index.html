                    instruction: `<p>Welcome! Gemini is an AI-powered assistant integrated directly into your Google Workspace apps (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, etc.). Its primary goal is to help you work smarter, faster, and more creatively.</p><p><strong>What Gemini Can Do for You:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Draft & Write:</strong> Get help creating emails, document sections, outlines, and more.</li><li><strong>Summarize:</strong> Quickly understand long documents or email threads.</li><li><strong>Brainstorm:</strong> Generate ideas for projects, content, or problem-solving.</li><li><strong>Refine:</strong> Improve your existing text by changing tone, length, or clarity.</li><li><strong>Organize:</strong> Assist with structuring information, like creating tables in Sheets.</li></ul><p>Think of Gemini as a versatile partner. As you explore these lessons, you'll learn how to make the most of its capabilities. Remember, while Gemini is powerful, you are always in control and responsible for the final output.</p>`,
                    example: `You're starting a new project proposal in Google Docs. You can ask Gemini: "Help me create an outline for a project proposal to launch a new internal communication platform. Include sections for objectives, target audience, key features, and timeline."`,
                },

                    lessonId: "game-gs-2",
                    title: "Finding Gemini in Your Apps 📍",
                    instruction: `<p>To use Gemini, you first need to know where to find it. Google has made it accessible within your Workspace tools, usually via a distinct icon or button.</p><p><strong>Common Access Points:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Gemini Icon (✨):</strong> Look for a "sparkle" icon. Clicking it often opens the Gemini side panel.</li><li><strong>Contextual Buttons:</strong> In apps like Gmail or Docs, you might see buttons like "Help me write," "Help me organize," or "Summarize" that invoke Gemini.</li><li><strong>Side Panel:</strong> In Docs, Sheets, and Slides, Gemini assistance is frequently available in a right-hand side panel.</li><li><strong>Gmail Compose Window:</strong> When writing or replying to emails.</li><li><strong>Meet Menus:</strong> AI features in Meet are often in the "More options" (...) or "Effects" panels.</li></ul><p>The exact placement can evolve with updates, but it's designed to be intuitive and available where you need it for your current task.</p>`,
                    example: `In Google Slides, you want to generate an image for your current slide. You would look for the Gemini icon ✨ in the right-hand sidebar to open the panel and type your image request.`,
                },
                {
                    lessonId: "game-gs-3",
                    title: "Your First Prompt & Basic Interaction 💬",
                    instruction: `<p>Interacting with Gemini involves giving it instructions or asking questions – these are called "prompts." For your first few tries, keep your prompts clear and simple to understand how Gemini responds.</p><p><strong>Tips for Simple Prompts:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Be Direct:</strong> Start with a clear action verb if you want Gemini to do something (e.g., "List...", "Explain...", "Summarize...").</li><li><strong>Focus on One Task:</strong> Avoid asking for too many different things in a single very short prompt.</li></ul><p><strong>Example Simple Prompts:</strong></p><ul><li><code>"List three advantages of using cloud storage."</code></li><li><code>"Explain the concept of 'project scope' in one sentence."</code></li><li><code>"What are some common time management techniques?"</code></li></ul><p>After you submit your prompt, Gemini will process it and provide a response in the panel. Always review this response!</p>`,
                    example: `You're in the Gemini panel in Docs and type: "Brainstorm five potential names for a new internal newsletter." Gemini will then list five suggestions for you to consider.`,
                },

                    lessonId: "game-gs-4",
                    title: "Interpreting & Refining Responses 🔄",
                    instruction: `<p>Gemini's first response is a starting point. Effective use often involves an iterative process – like a conversation – where you refine its suggestions.</p><p><strong>After Gemini responds, ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>Is it accurate and relevant?</li><li>Is the tone and style appropriate?</li><li>Is it too long, too short, or missing something?</li></ul><p><strong>Common Refinement Prompts:</strong></p><ul><li><code>"Make that more concise."</code></li><li><code>"Rewrite this in a formal tone."</code></li><li><code>"Can you elaborate on the second point?"</code></li><li><code>"Give me another option for that."</code></li></ul><p>This back-and-forth helps you tailor the AI's output precisely to your needs. Remember, you are accountable for the final accuracy of the content.</p>`,
                    example: `Gemini drafts an email that's a bit too wordy. You follow up with the prompt: "Shorten this email to focus only on the main action item and the deadline."`,
                },

                    title: "Using Gemini Responsibly & Securely 🛡️",
                    instruction: `<p>Using Gemini effectively includes using it responsibly. This is crucial for protecting company information and ensuring ethical AI use.</p><p><strong>Core Principles to Always Remember:</strong></p><ul><li>🚫 <strong>Protect Sensitive Information:</strong> This is paramount. <strong>NEVER</strong> input confidential company data (e.g., unreleased financials, strategy documents), customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information like names, contacts, account details), or sensitive employee information into Gemini prompts.</li><li>✅ <strong>Verify All Outputs:</strong> You are accountable for any content Gemini helps generate. Always critically review for accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness before using or sharing. Fact-check important data.</li><li>👍 <strong>Understand Limitations:</strong> Gemini is an assistant. It doesn't "know" things like humans do and can make mistakes. It's not a substitute for your professional judgment or critical thinking.</li><li>🔄 <strong>Be Mindful of Bias:</strong> AI models can reflect biases from their training data. Be aware of this and review outputs for fairness and inclusivity.</li></ul>`,
                    example: `You need to draft a customer complaint response. Instead of prompting Gemini with "Draft a response to John Doe (acct#123) about his complaint regarding order #XYZ," you prompt: "Draft a polite and empathetic template for responding to a customer complaint about a delayed order." You then manually and securely fill in the specific customer details yourself.`,

                    lessonId: "game-gs-6",
                    title: "Giving Gemini Context (Safely!) 🔗",
                    instruction: `<p>Gemini provides more relevant assistance when it has context about your task. You can provide this context in a few ways, always keeping data safety in mind.</p><p><strong>Methods for Providing Context:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Implicit Context (Open File):</strong> Often, Gemini can understand the content of the document, email, or sheet you have open and active when you prompt it from the side panel. For example, asking "Summarize this" in an open Doc.</li><li><strong>Referencing Files (@mentions):</strong> In some apps (like Docs, Gmail), you can type <code>@</code> followed by a file name to allow Gemini to access content from that specific Drive file. Example: <code>"Summarize the key recommendations from @[Q1 Sales Strategy.gdoc]"</code>.</li></ul><p><strong>Crucial Safety Note:</strong> Before asking Gemini to process information from *any* document or file (whether open or @mentioned), **you must ensure that the file itself does not contain sensitive PII or confidential company information** that should not be processed by an AI. You are responsible for the data you direct Gemini to access.</p>`,
                    example: `You are writing a project update email in Gmail. You prompt Gemini: "Help me draft this update. Include the main action items from our last meeting, which are in @[Project Phoenix Meeting Notes - May 28.gdoc]." (You've already ensured the meeting notes doc is safe to use.)`,

                    title: "Core Elements of a Great Prompt ✨",
                    instruction: `<p>To get the best results from Gemini, structure your prompts thoughtfully. While not always needed, understanding these five core elements (often remembered by an acronym like <strong>PTCFT</strong>) can make your prompts much more powerful, especially for complex requests:</p><ul><li><strong>Persona:</strong> Who should Gemini act as? (e.g., "Act as a marketing expert...") This sets the style and expertise.</li><li><strong>Task:</strong> What specific action do you want Gemini to perform? (e.g., "Draft an email...", "Summarize this text...", "List three ideas...") Use clear action verbs.</li><li><strong>Context:</strong> What background information does Gemini need to understand your request fully? (e.g., "for a new client in the tech industry," "based on our Q1 sales data"). Remember to <strong>never include sensitive PII or confidential company data.</strong></li><li><strong>Format:</strong> How do you want the information presented? (e.g., "as a bulleted list," "in a table with columns for X and Y," "as a short paragraph").</li><li><strong>Tone:</strong> What style should the response have? (e.g., "formal," "friendly and encouraging," "neutral and objective," "persuasive").</li></ul><p>Consciously thinking about these elements will help you craft prompts that lead to more accurate and useful outputs.</p>`,
                    example: `A well-structured prompt: "Act as an experienced project manager (Persona). Draft a three-point agenda (Task & Format) for a weekly project sync meeting for 'Project Alpha' (Context). The tone should be professional and concise (Tone)."`,
                },

                    lessonId: "game-mp-2",
                    title: "Clear Prompts & Iterative Refinement ✍️",
                    instruction: `<p>Clear and concise language in your prompts is key to avoiding misinterpretations by Gemini. Use simple terms, be specific with nouns and verbs, and define any unique acronyms if necessary.</p><p><strong>The Power of Iteration:</strong></p><p>Don't expect the perfect answer on the first try, especially for complex tasks. Effective prompting is often an iterative process:</p><ol><li><strong>Initial Prompt:</strong> Give your first instruction.</li><li><strong>Analyze Response:</strong> See what Gemini produced. What's good? What's missing or needs changing?</li><li><strong>Refine Your Prompt:</strong> Based on the response, adjust your original prompt or create a follow-up. You might add more detail, clarify the task, change the requested tone/format, or ask Gemini to elaborate/shorten its previous answer.</li><li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue this cycle until you get the desired result.</li></ol><p>Each iteration helps "teach" Gemini what you're looking for in that specific conversation.</p>`,
                    example: `Initial prompt: "Tell me about marketing." (Too vague). Gemini's response: Very general marketing definition. Refined prompt: "Act as a digital marketing consultant. List three effective strategies for a small e-commerce business to increase online visibility on a limited budget. Focus on social media and content marketing." (Much better!)`,

                    lessonId: "game-mp-3",
                    title: "Getting Specific Outputs (Lists, etc.) 📋",
                    instruction: `<p>You can direct Gemini to structure its response in specific formats, making the information easier to use. Clearly state the format you want in your prompt.</p><p><strong>Common Formats to Request:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Lists:</strong> "List five advantages of..." (Specify "numbered list" or "bullet points" if preferred).</li><li><strong>Summaries:</strong> "Summarize this article in three key sentences." (You can specify length/focus).</li><li><strong>Tables:</strong> "Create a table comparing Product A and Product B with columns for Features, Price, and User Rating." (Define your columns).</li><li><strong>Email Drafts:</strong> "Draft a professional email to..."</li><li><strong>Paragraphs:</strong> "Write a short paragraph explaining..."</li></ul><p>Specifying the format saves you time re-organizing Gemini's output later.</p>`,
                    example: `Prompt: "Generate a list of 10 potential blog post titles about 'The Future of Remote Work', presented as a numbered list."`,

                    title: "Pro Tip: Chain Prompts for Complex Tasks 🔗",
                    instruction: `<p>For intricate or multi-step tasks, "chain prompting" is a powerful technique. Instead of one massive prompt, you break the task into smaller, sequential prompts, using Gemini's output from one step to inform the next.</p><p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p><ol><li>Define your overall goal.</li><li>Break it into logical sub-tasks.</li><li>Prompt for the first sub-task.</li><li>Use Gemini's response to help formulate your prompt for the second sub-task (e.g., "Based on the outline you just provided, draft the introduction...").</li><li>Continue until the overall goal is achieved.</li></ol><p>This gives you more control and often leads to higher quality, more detailed results for complex projects.</p>`,
                    example: `Goal: Create a short report. Prompt 1: "Brainstorm an outline for a report on employee engagement." (Gemini provides an outline) Prompt 2: "Using the first section of that outline ('Introduction'), draft a compelling opening paragraph." (And so on for other sections...)`,

                    instruction: `<p>Avoiding common pitfalls will make your interactions with Gemini much smoother and more effective.</p><p><strong>Common Mistakes & Solutions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Too Vague:</strong> Gemini gives generic answers. <strong>Fix:</strong> Be more specific, add context. (e.g., Instead of "project update," try "Draft a 3-bullet project update for Project Phoenix focusing on last week's achievements.")</li><li><strong>Not Enough Context:</strong> Output isn't relevant to your situation. <strong>Fix:</strong> Provide necessary background information (without sharing sensitive data!).</li><li><strong>Overly Complex (Too many tasks in one prompt):</strong> Gemini gets confused or misses instructions. <strong>Fix:</strong> Break it down into smaller, focused prompts (use chain prompting).</li><li><strong>Forgetting Format/Tone:</strong> Output is hard to use or sounds wrong. <strong>Fix:</strong> Specify desired format (list, table, email) and tone (formal, friendly) in your prompt.</li><li><strong>Not Reviewing:</strong> Using AI output without checking. <strong>Fix:</strong> Always critically review for accuracy and appropriateness.</li></ul>`,
                    example: `Mistake: "Tell me about that report." (Too vague, which report?) Better: "Summarize the key findings from the 'Q3 Sales Report 2024.gdoc' that I have open." (Assuming it's safe to reference).`,

It's like having an assistant to get you past the blank page.</p><p><strong>To get a strong first draft, tell Gemini:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Recipient/Audience:</strong> Who is this email for? (e.g., "my manager," "a potential client," "the project team"). This helps Gemini set the right level of formality.</li><li><strong>Purpose of the Email:</strong> What do you want to achieve? (e.g., "to schedule a follow-up meeting," "to announce a new policy," "to request specific information").</li><li><strong>Key Information to Include:</strong> List the main points, data, or questions that must be in the email.</li><li><strong>Desired Tone:</strong> How should the email sound? (e.g., "formal and professional," "friendly and encouraging," "urgent but polite").</li></ul><p>Always remember to review and personalize any AI-generated draft. Ensure no sensitive PII or confidential company data is included if the email is external or discusses such topics. You are responsible for the final message.</p>`,
                    example: `Prompt: "Draft a formal email to 'newsupplier@example.com' introducing our company, briefly explaining our interest in their eco-friendly packaging solutions, and requesting their latest product catalog and pricing information. Ask for a response by next Friday."`,

This is especially useful when you have many files.</p><p><strong>How Gemini Assists with Drive:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Smart Search:</strong> Use natural language to find files. Instead of just keywords, you can ask: <code>"Find the presentation about Q3 marketing results that Sarah shared last month."</code> (This often works via the Gemini side panel in Workspace apps or a dedicated Gemini interface that can access Drive).</li><li><strong>Summarizing Files:</strong> Once a file is identified (e.g., using an <code>@mention</code> like <code>@[Project Plan Q4.gdoc]</code> in a prompt if you're in Docs or Gmail), or if Gemini can directly access Drive content, you can ask it to summarize. Example: <code>"Summarize the main objectives outlined in @[Project Plan Q4.gdoc]."</code></li></ul><p>Always ensure that any file you ask Gemini to summarize or access is appropriate for AI processing and doesn't contain overly sensitive PII or confidential company data that shouldn't be processed this way.</p>`,
                    example: `You're looking for a specific budget spreadsheet but can't remember the exact file name. You prompt Gemini (perhaps in a general Workspace search or side panel): "Find my Google Sheet related to the 'Alpha Project' budget from last quarter."

                    instruction: `<p>AI models like Gemini learn from vast amounts of data. This data can sometimes reflect existing societal biases related to gender, race, age, or other characteristics. It's important to be aware that AI-generated content might inadvertently perpetuate these biases.</p><p><strong>Strategies to Promote Fairness:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Be Aware & Critical:</strong> Actively look for potential bias in Gemini's responses. Does it make assumptions or use stereotypes?</li><li><strong>Use Inclusive Language in Prompts:</strong> Frame your requests using neutral and inclusive terms. Avoid gendered pronouns or stereotypical descriptions unless absolutely necessary and appropriate for the context.</li><li><strong>Specify Fairness:</strong> You can explicitly ask Gemini to "provide a balanced perspective" or "ensure the response considers diverse viewpoints."</li><li><strong>Challenge Stereotypical Outputs:</strong> If a response seems biased, ask Gemini to reconsider or rephrase it from a more neutral standpoint.</li><li><strong>Focus on Positive Framing:</strong> When asking for descriptions or solutions, focus on positive attributes and desired outcomes rather than reinforcing negative stereotypes.</li></ul><p>Your vigilance helps ensure that our use of AI promotes fairness and inclusivity.</p>`,
                    example: `Instead of prompting: "Describe the typical characteristics of a successful salesperson" (which might elicit a biased response), try: "Describe key skills and diverse attributes that contribute to success in a sales role, ensuring an inclusive perspective."`,

                    instruction: `<p>While Gemini can provide information quickly, it's not infallible. It can sometimes generate incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information (often called "hallucinations"). Therefore, critically evaluating and fact-checking its output is essential, especially for important work.</p><p><strong>Advanced Evaluation Techniques:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cross-Verify with Trusted Sources:</strong> For any factual claims, statistics, dates, or critical data points provided by Gemini, always try to verify them against official company data, reputable industry reports, or other reliable sources.</li><li><strong>Question Assumptions:</strong> Does the AI's response make logical sense within the context of your knowledge? Are there any underlying assumptions in its response that need to be challenged?</li><li><strong>Look for Nuance & Context:</strong> AI might sometimes oversimplify complex issues. Consider if the AI-generated content captures the necessary nuance for your specific purpose.</li><li><strong>"Does this *feel* right?":</strong> Trust your professional intuition. If something seems off or too good to be true, investigate further.</li></ul><p>Treat AI-generated content as a helpful starting point or a draft that requires your expert review and validation.</p>`,
                    example: `Gemini helps draft a section of a report that includes market size statistics. Before finalizing the report, you cross-reference these statistics with your company's market research database and a recent reputable industry analysis publication to ensure accuracy.`,

                    instruction: `<p>The first image generated by AI might not always be exactly what you envisioned. Just like with text prompts, iterative refinement is key to getting better visual results.</p><p><strong>Techniques for Refining Image Prompts:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Add More Detail:</strong> If the image is too generic, add specific elements, colors, or actions. <em>Before: "A dog." After: "A fluffy golden retriever puppy chasing a red ball in a sunny park."</em></li><li><strong>Change or Specify Style:</strong> If the style isn't right, explicitly ask for a different one. <em>Before: "A flower."

Strive for diverse and inclusive representations. Avoid prompts that could lead to stereotypical depictions based on gender, race, age, etc. If an output seems biased, refine your prompt to be more inclusive.</li><li><strong>Copyright & Ownership:</strong> Understand your company's policy and the terms of service of the AI tool regarding the usage rights of images generated by AI. Generally, be cautious about using AI-generated images for public commercial purposes without clear rights.</li><li><strong>Authenticity & Disclosure:</strong> Consider when it might be appropriate or necessary to disclose that an image is AI-generated, especially in external communications or if there's a risk of misinterpretation.</li><li><strong>Respect for Likeness (Deepfakes):</strong> Never use AI image generation tools to create unauthorized or misleading images of real individuals (deepfakes). This is unethical and often illegal.</li><li><strong>Harmful Content:</strong> Do not attempt to generate images that are offensive, discriminatory, explicit, or otherwise violate ethical guidelines or company policy.</li></ul><p>Using AI image generation tools responsibly ensures we leverage their creative power without causing harm or misrepresentation.</p>`,

                    example: `Initial Prompt: "Information about that meeting." Gemini's Response: "I'm not sure which meeting you're referring to. Could you please provide more details?"

                    instruction: `<p>AI models like Gemini can occasionally generate information that is incorrect, seems out of context, or doesn't make sense (sometimes called "hallucinations"). It's crucial to approach AI outputs with a critical mindset.</p><p><strong>What to Do with Unexpected or Inaccurate Outputs:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>DON'T Trust Blindly:</strong> Never assume AI-generated content is 100% accurate or factual without review, especially for important information.</li><li><strong>Fact-Check & Verify:</strong> If Gemini provides specific data, statistics, dates, or factual claims, try to verify them against trusted internal sources (like company data) or reputable external resources before relying on them.</li><li><strong>Refine or Re-Prompt:</strong> Ask Gemini to try again. You might say, <code>"That doesn't seem correct, can you check that information?"</code> or provide more constraints to guide it.</li><li><strong>Provide Feedback (If Available):</strong> Many AI tools, including Google's, have mechanisms (like thumbs up/down) to provide feedback on responses. This helps improve the AI over time.</li><li><strong>Use Your Judgment:</strong> Your expertise and common sense are vital. If a response seems strange or counter-intuitive, investigate further.</li></ul><p>Remember, you are responsible for the accuracy and appropriateness of any information you use from Gemini.</p>`,
                    example: `You ask Gemini for the founding date of a specific historical company. The date provided seems much later than you recall. Before using it in a report, you quickly check a reliable historical website or encyclopedia to confirm the correct date.`,

                    title: "Getting Help: Official & Company Resources ",
                    instruction: `<p>If you encounter persistent issues, need more detailed information, or want to learn about the latest Gemini features, there are several resources available:</p><ul><li><strong>Google Workspace Learning Center:</strong> This is a primary source for official guides, tips, and FAQs on Gemini and all Workspace apps. (This learning hub you're using is based on its principles!)</li><li><strong>In-App Help:</strong> Look for "?" icons or "Help" menus within Google Workspace applications. They often provide contextual assistance or links to relevant support articles.</li><li><strong>Official Google Blogs:</strong> The Google Workspace Blog and the Google AI Blog are excellent places to find announcements about new features, updates, and best practices.</li><li><strong>CitizenM's Internal Resources:</strong> Your IT department has specific guidance, training materials, and support channels for using Gemini.
